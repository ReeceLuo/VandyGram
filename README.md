# About this project:
This project is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). At first, the project felt daunting because of the number of moving parts across the frontend and backend, but as I learned about the different technologies, I became more confident in connecting each pieze into a cohesive, robust system. I reinforced my understanding of how APIs enable communication between different layers of an application and gained a stronger grasp of state management in React. I also learned valuable debugging techniques, especially when using TypeScript to nail down the frontend and authentication for api calls. Overall, this project was a rewarding experience that strengthened both my technical and problem-solving skills.
